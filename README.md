# Email_Tracking_Web_Apps
Software Engineering Degree Final Year Project<br/>

# Requirement
An NGO provides an email counseling service to clients. They require an application that is more<br/>
advanced than the standard email client functionality (such as Outlook) to automatically track of the<br/>
issues of each of these callers to better provide support to them.<br/>

# Expected Deliverances
<ul>
<li>Ability to pull emails back using a suitable web API (for Gmail) or from the NGO’s hosting email server</li>
<li>Classify the emails appropriately according to the date, sender, etc and extract relevant info from these<br/>
emails to be stored in a backend database</li>
<li>Allow users to add annotations to these records which form part of the counseling record for the client,<br/>
and use this in reference to the clients</li>
<li>Provide a synchronization log to allow the NGO’s volunteers to work on multiple emails at the same
time.</li>
 </ul>
